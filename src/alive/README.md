Objects defined in this folder are, well, not literally "alive", they just can interact with each other. 
Like, a stone is "alive" if it can be moved due to some game logic. 
And even if the stone is not movable, it is still treated as "alive" if it affects other "alive" objects somehow (like blocking a path).

I just wanted to call it with a word less general than a "Component" or an "Element"
